# Wizard-API (Wizard Library)
A copy of Tim Boudreau's Wizard project. Originally hosted at https://wizard.dev.java.net

This is a fork of https://github.com/karchie/Wizard because it's the only repository I could find that had the complete commit history. 
There's also another repository at https://github.com/Lonzak/Wizard-API/ that contains version 1.1 but without the complete history.
